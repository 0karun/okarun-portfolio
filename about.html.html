<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Arun Manikandan from Tenkasi. I’m a nature lover at heart and dream of living a life close to it. I graduated with a B.E. in
   Mechanical Engineering, but my passions have taken me in a completely different direction. I’m an introvert who loves watching movies (Interstellar is my favorite),
    anime, and listening to music. Football is my favorite sport, and I enjoy playing it whenever I get the chance. I also love gaming and exploring new adventures through travel.
</p>

<p>I’ve always been drawn to creativity and technology. I started a YouTube channel where I share stories using AI-generated images 
  and voiceovers, combining tech with storytelling. I also created an NFT collection with 740 unique pieces, diving into the world of digital art. Recently,
   I’ve been focused on full-stack development and UI/UX design, building my skills to create and innovate.
</p>

<p>Even though I haven’t worked a traditional job yet, my projects and experiences have taught me so much. 
  I’ve learned to take on challenges, stay curious, and keep growing.</p>
